## Week 1 Meeting (June 4)

We went through three examples: 

* Creating a graph that showed countries' medal-standings for the Sochi Olympics (since the R code pulled data directly from a website, it could be updated by just re-running the code as standings changed during the Olympics)
* Showing worldwide incidence of pirate attacks since 1978 through a series of pngs created with R
* Finding the best meeting point on the Paris metro via a Shiny app

Pieces of example code to play with for these examples are included in the .R files. All examples came from others' blogs-- full attribution is provided in the comments of the R code for each example.
